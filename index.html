            A short bio
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am not originally from Michigan but instead have moved a ton around the United States.
            Also I am just a big pokemon fan and I'm worried about finishing this in time so I'm gonna talk about that
        </p>
        <h2>
            Underrated pokemon
        </h2>
        <h3>How I decide who is underrated</h3>
        <p>There are a ton of mons and so there are a ton of great ones that are underrated that I wont mention, and that's because I can only list 5 and don't care that much man.
            So I am just choosing to talk about ones that I like but don't find people talk about.
        </p>
        <h3>My list also isnt in any order</h3>
